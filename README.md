# BodySystem

This is just the scripts we used in our body system senior final project in unity.
I decided to do it this way when I noticed literally any game I tried to upload on here would be too big. 
So only the scripts we use to build/assist with our project will be present here. 
Its fine, because that's what our main focus should be anyway, our coding, I think.
